She eventually becomes a Headmaster with Daniel (in an Exo-suit) forming her head. Although she has been paired with Springer (for most of Season 3), Chromedome (2 episodes of the second half of Headmasters) and Brainstorm (most of the second half of Headmasters), she seems to be more attached to Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime (in the Movie and Dark Awakening and the first half of Headmasters).",

Enormous height, incredible strength - can knock down a bridge with one punch. Has 10,000 degrees Celsius solar energy beam rifle. Slow, awkward, not too bright. Revealed in the episode \"The Secert Of Omega Supreme\" that Devastator and Omega Supreme used to be friends; the Constructicons built Crystal City on Cybertron, while Omega Supreme guarded it. But, one day, Megatron's Robo-Smasher reprogrammed the Constructicons to be Megatron's loyal servants. The very same day, they tricked Omega Supreme into thinking that the outskirts of the city was in danger. Because Omega Supreme bought it, what he didn't know was that he was tricked, but, by the time he realized he was fooled, it was too late, for the Constructicons already destroyed Crystal City while Omega Supreme shouted \"NO!!!!!!!!\". When he got back, he realized that the Constructicons' reprogramming was Megatron's work, so Omega Supreme vowed to find his former frineds, get their reprogramming eraesed, and kill Megatron. Weeks later, Omega Supreme finally tracked down the Constructicons. He blasted a hole on the road to trap the Constructicons and knock them out, one by one, long enough for Omega Supreme to erase their reprogramming. But what Omega Supreme didn't know was that Megatron's work couldn't be reversed and that Omega Supreme's former pals were given a new transformation: Devastator. When Devaststor lured Omega Supreme into the Robo-Smasher to be reprogrammed, it didn't work, for Omega Supreme's strength matched Devastator's, so the Robo-Smasher blew up, and Omega Supreme's hatred for Megatron was gone, but now, Omega Supreme felt hatred toward the Constructicons and vowed to kill them, either one by one, or if they all merged into Devastator.",
